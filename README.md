## 1. Rules of naming
* Variable naming:

    * Private variables: private variables need to have m before variable name:

        * mcount
        * mvalue
        * mprivate_member

    * Public variables: public variable words are seperated by _ and are in lower bounds:

        * public_member
        * value
        * count

* Method naming:

    * Private methods: private methods need to have m before variable name and after first word next words of name methods are upper bound:

        * mcount()
        * mvalue()
        * mprivateMember()

    * Public variables: public methods after first word next words of name methods are upper bound:

        * publicMember()
        * value()
        * count()

## 2. File structure is in progress
## 3. Documentation is required, if method is changed need to update documentation also
## 4. TODO
* Change constant value namings 
* Change Column class method findLength for integer and double, that would search for max value and the find the number of digits the values is made of (Better efficiency).
