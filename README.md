    * Public variables: public variable words are seperated by _ and are in lower bounds:

        * public_member
        * value
        * count

* Method naming:

    * Private methods: private methods need to have m before variable name and after first word next words of name methods are upper bound:

        * mcount()
        * mvalue()
        * mprivateMember()
